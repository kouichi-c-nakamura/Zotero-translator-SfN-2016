Although I have made [a Pull Request](https://github.com/zotero/translators/pull/1427) for [Zotero translators](https://github.com/zotero/translators), it's stuck and has not been added to Zotero. I decided to create a separate repo on its own.



## Installation 

1. Find and open your Zotero data directory from Preferences > Advanced > Files and Folders > Data  Directory Location > Show Data  Directory.
2. Find the folder `translators`
3. Download `Society for Neuroscience Abstract 2016.js` and place it in the `translators` folder.
4. Restart your Zotero and web browser.

## Note

- If the abstract page is not detected for the translator, try reloading the page a few times and usually it works.
